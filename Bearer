In accordance with clause 12.1 of the Contract, the Seller undertook to transfer the goods to the Buyer, namely: construction materials according to Appendix number 1, by 00.00.0000.
In accordance with clause 14.2 of the Agreement, the Buyer 00.00.0000 made the payment on time stipulated in the Agreement, that is, paid for the goods in full (partially) in the amount of 600,000 rubles before the Seller transferred the goods (advance payment).
However, to date, the goods have not been transferred by the Seller to the Buyer.
In accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 487 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, if the seller who received the amount of advance payment does not fulfill the obligation to transfer the goods within the prescribed period, the buyer has the right to demand the transfer of the paid goods or the refund of the amount of advance payment for goods not transferred by the seller.

of the amount previously paid by him.
According to paragraph 1 of Article 395 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, in cases of unlawful withholding of funds, evasion of their return, or other delay in their payment, interest on the amount of the debt is payable. The amount of interest is determined by the key rate of the Bank of Russia, which was in effect during the relevant periods. These rules apply unless a different amount of interest is established by law or contract.
Based on the above and guided by paragraphs 1 of Article 395, paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 487 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, the buyer refuses to execute the contract of sale and demands to refund the amount of advance payment for the goods under the contract of sale in the amount of 600,000 rubles and 23,598 rubles of interest for using other people's money, a total of 623 598 rubles.
In case of complete or partial refusal to satisfy this claim within 10 days, the Buyer will be forced to file a claim with the court in accordance with the established procedure to protect his legitimate rights and interests.
