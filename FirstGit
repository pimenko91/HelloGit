Reset or no ?


The shuttle hovered over the landing platform, the skin plates parted with a slight clang, releasing a six-wheeled landing gear. The platform shuddered and sank with a hiss under the weight of the shuttle, throwing out white streams of steam from the side compensators. However, the compensating hydraulics quickly adjusted to the weight of the ship and raised the platform back to its previous level. A translucent drop of a bus quickly rushed from the spaceport building standing two hundred meters from the platform to the landed ship.

– Dear passengers, our shuttle landed at the Novosibirsk spaceport, I hope you enjoyed the flight. In a second, the "c-field" will be turned off and you will be able to go to the exit, please do not forget your belongings.

The hologram of the flight attendant smiled sweetly and, curling up into a thin luminous thread, disappeared into thin air. Immediately, the lights on the armrests of the chair went out, indicating the work of the "c-field", and people began to get up from their seats, slowly heading for the exit.

A tall man dressed in uniform, though without any insignia, who was sitting at the back of the shuttle and dozed off the entire flight, also got up and, going to a small cylindrical pedestal located almost at the airlock, put the stub of a plastic ticket into a special slot. The cabinet immediately rumbled contentedly, blinked a few lights, and its upper part turned around its axis, revealing a roomy cavity in which a tightly stuffed sports bag lay. The man picked up this bag and, turning around, headed for the exit.

The earth greeted him with a light breeze and a gentle sun. He stood at the top of the ramp, exposing his face to the wind, and smiled happily.
"Citizen, excuse me, please, but the bus is waiting for you,– came a voice behind him.

He looked over his shoulder and saw the stewardess standing in the airlock aisle, this time alive, not holographic. Blond, almost a girl, dressed in a white and blue, more like a sports leotard, uniform, she looked at him with interest, apparently trying to determine which planet he came from.

"Excuse me," he smiled affably and clasped his hands in a prayer gesture. – Don't be angry with me, I haven't been home for so long.

– Okay, – the girl frowned, pretending to be angry, but could not restrain herself and laughed fervently. – Go to the escalator.

He nodded and, giving her another smile, quickly ran down the ramp, ending up on the escalator tape sliding into the depths of the platform. A couple of minutes down the neon-lit tunnel, and he is already standing in front of the open doors of the bus. Many of the shuttle passengers seated on the bus looked at him reproachfully. In response, he just spread his hands guiltily.

– That's it, – a familiar girl appeared in the doorway. Lifting her hand with a massive bracelet on it, she stared at the lines running across the screen for a few seconds, then looked around the salon again and smiled. – It's all right, have a nice trip.

The doors closed smoothly, the bus took off and, famously turning around almost on the spot, headed for the shiny crystal of the spaceport building.

That's all the customs control, the man grinned. On many other planets of the human enclave, it is difficult to even imagine such a thing, there you will be enlightened tenfold, and your documents will be studied, almost to the molecular structure. And here, on the old Earth, located on the outskirts of human settlements, everything is as before.
Although no, there is something new. For example, this is the building of the spaceport, which looks like a huge faceted diamond sparkling in the rays of the sun. Thirty years ago, in its place was a squat building made of foam concrete with huge windows.

Thirty years… He leaned back in the bus seat and looked out the window absently, his hand sliding with a familiar movement to the breast pocket of his tunic.

A small dolphin figurine. A mentano-plastic keychain is a trinket bought in those distant years. The seller assured that it was worth stroking him, and he would start beating his tail and singing melodious trills, but ... but only if there were those who really loved and appreciated you. It had been a long time since he had felt its fluttering and heard its soft whistle. Although during this time, it most likely just broke down or the mentan lost its properties.
The bus dived inside the spaceport and began to slow down, then stopped. The passengers, talking, slowly reached for the doors. He also picked up his bag and moved towards the exit with everyone.

The spaceport greeted him with the usual bustle common to all stations in the galaxy. He walked between the hurrying people, marveling at their number. Thirty years ago, there were only four of them in an empty hall.

After asking one of the passengers for directions and getting a little lost, he nevertheless went out to the taxi stand five minutes later.

Small cars of various shapes and colors filled the parking lot. Occasionally, one of them lifted off the ground and, rising into the air, disappeared with a slight whistle in the distance. As soon as he approached the nearest one, its shape resembling a flattened triangle, its door opened in greeting, sliding sideways. The man sat inside, and immediately a map of the city unfolded in the air in front of him.

– Choose the place where you would like to go! An insinuating voice rang in my head.

He studied the map for a few seconds, then, having lost his way through the unfamiliar interface of the program, he removed the map of the city, and a map of the nearest settlements appeared in front of him. After selecting the right one, he pressed the confirmation button, but the car remained in place, but the voice sounded in his head again.

– Sorry, but this site is outside the jurisdiction of our department, we recommend using the services of the intercity transport network.

The newcomer sat in the taxi seat for a few minutes, thinking about something, then got out with a sigh.

– What, he's not coming?

A short guy dressed in a gray jacket and jeans approached the taxi.

– Yes, I wanted to go to the River.

– I see, – the guy nodded. – If you want, I'll give you a ride.

– Is it really a taxi driver? The man was surprised.

–Just a little bit," the guy waved his hand. – I work here in the control room, well, sometimes I let someone down, they are not superfluous rubles.
